Slides for a talk at the DGL conference 2024

The talk aims to present ideas how web-based applications may reduce barriers and fear of modeling and data science. It links to some own examples.

The slides contain an active component using web-assembly and [web-r](https://docs.r-wasm.org/).

To enable it, open a terminal in RStudio and then install

```
quarto add coatless/quarto-webr
``` 

Then render it in RStudio as usual. The resulting html-file is then able to execute R code on your local PC.
