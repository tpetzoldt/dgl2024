## Qualified People?

![Search for qualified students who are interested in ecology **and** modeling](img/unitag.jpg)

## Current Situation

<br>

$\Rightarrow$ Modeling and data science became an important part of limnology.

<br>


**Demand in Research and Engineering**

* people who can [use]{.cyan} computers
* people who can [understand]{.cyan} models
* people who are able to [develop]{.cyan} models

**School Experience** 

* [mathematics]{.neongreen} is complicated
* [programming]{.neongreen} is something for nerds 
* differential [calculus]{.neongreen} is rocket science


<!--

## Ecology and Modeling Skills at Different Levels

<br>

**1. Field and Laboratory Ecologists**

- Skills: Field and lab ecology, hypotheses, fundamental stats/modeling
- Role: Experimental design, perform experiments, collect data, conduct research

**2. Ecological Data Analysts and modelers**

- Skills: Ecology, statistics and modeling, programming, computation
- Role: Analyze data, develop models, simulate processes, interpret outcomes

**3. Ecological Data Science and Modeling Specialists**

- Skills: Data science, machine learning + AI, fundamentals of ecology
- Role: Create algorithms, develop data-driven and knowledge-based solutions
-->

<!--

## Different target groups

<br>

1. General Public
2. Interested public
3. People with domain specific education
4. Specialists

<br>

**Example**

* School kids and their parents
* People who are aware of climate change
* Participants of an ecological conference
* Reservoir management professionals

Common in most application domains: ecology, modeling, social science, art

-->

# What to do? {data-background-color="#006ab2"}

## Approach it from two sides

<br>

Ecologists $\leftarrow$ **modeling**

Data scientists $\leftarrow$ **ecology**

<br>

* Introduce ecology **and** modeling early
* Reduce barriers: success experience -- respect but no fear
* Use a playful approach and motivate for more:
    - Link back to the scientific fundamentals of ecology / modeling.
    - Motivate to find the right depth level, from "interested" to "professional"

<br>

Openness, courage, problem-solving skills, collaboration



## Example 1: Lake Profile Plotter

<br></br>

::: {.column width="49%"}
* COVID online teaching
* Multiparameter probe data
    - Complex interactions between temperature, light, algae, oxygen, pH, conductivity
    - Excel data structures, plotting, trend line, colors, ... distract from content
    - Limited time
:::

$\Rightarrow$ Has also passed its acid test in field courses.

## Example 2: Climate Data Explorer

The image is rather small, but the idea is to either:

- zoom in with Alt + Mouse click to center of Zoom region
- open link: it opens in a new browser tab, then move back by selecting the presentation tab
--->

<br></br>

::: {.column width="33%"}

<br></br>

* Visualisation of climate data and trends
* Direct access to data from the [German Weather Service](https://www.dwd.de)
* Used in teaching and for public outreach

## Example 3: Reservoir Management with GOTM

<br></br>

::: {.column width="33%"}

<br></br>

* 1D hydrophysical model provided as web service
* Predefined scenarios
* Quick performance
* Results can be downloaded

# Cinema is not enough!<br> Focus on Processes {data-background-color="#006ab2"}


## Which kind of description is the simplest?

<br>

**Example: Logistic Growth Model**

<br>

Difference Equation

$$
N_{t+1} = N_t + r_{max} \cdot N_{t} \cdot \left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)
$$

Differential equation

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dN}{dt} &= r_{max}  \cdot N\cdot \left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right)
\end{align}
$$

Closed-form integral solution

$$
N_t = \frac{K N_0 e^{r t}}{K + N_0 (e^{r t}-1)}
$$


## Advantages and Disadvantages

<br>

* **Mechanism vs. Solution:**<br> The differential equation form is more intuitive for understanding underlying mechanisms.
* **Accessibility:**<br> The closed-form solution can be less intimidating for those unfamiliar with calculus.
* **Complexity:**<br> Closed-form solutions can become difficult or impossible for complex models.


**Priority**

* Understanding the dynamics of systems, focusing on changes, gains, and losses, rather than excessive calculus.

**Implementation**

* Employ numerical solvers to analyze complex models.

**... and then gain a deeper understanding**

* "Many believe that system dynamics has helped them become skilled at
inventing the future, either by sketching out causal loops on the 
back of an envelope, or by assembling equations of cause and effect in a
computer model. Both approaches work." (Forrester, 1995)

without ever discovering that their elders consider such to be very difficult."

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{dN}{dt} &= \mbox{birth} - \mbox{death}\\
              &= b \cdot N - d \cdot N\\
\frac{dN}{dt} &= r \cdot N\\

## Implementation

::: {.column width="32%"}

Exponential growth

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = r \cdot N
$$

<br>


Logistic growth

$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = r \cdot N \cdot \left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)\\
$$

<br>

**Exercise**

1. Run the code.
2. Modify it to simulate logistic growth.
3. Play with the parameter values.

## Outlook: Growth Model Dashboard

## Conclusions

<br>

### Possibilities

* Evolving technologies for data analysis and modeling
* Server-based or on local computer
* Numerical libraries, visualization, reporting and presentation freely available

<br>

### Challenges

* Modern didactic concepts needed, technical approach is not enough.
* Formulation of texts:
    - detailed vs. brief explanations?
    - appropriate level? [(background knowledge would make understanding easier)]{.gray}
* Graphical presentation will need professionals.
* Avoid "cinema mode" 
* Encourage further studies and the motivation to dig deeper.
